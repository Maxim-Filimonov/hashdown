== DESCRIPTION:

finder is a super light rails plugin that adds hash-style lookups to ActiveRecord models

== EXAMPLE:

Given the following class definition:

  class State < ActiveRecord::Base
    finder :abbreviation
  end

You can look up states via their abbreviations like so:

  @colorado = State[:co]

This is roughly equivalent to the following implementation:

  class State < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_uniqueness_of :abbreviation

    def self.[](state_code)
      find_by_abbreviation(state_code)
    end
  end

...except it adds ActiveSupport caching for speedy lookups.
